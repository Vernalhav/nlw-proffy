# Proffy
Proffy is a simple website made during Rocketseat's Next Level Week advanced module.
It is a platform for teachers and students to connect and arrange classes of different subjects.  
  
# Usage  
This project requires Node.js, npm and optionally yarn.  
If you would like to host the website, first clone the [back-end repo](https://github.com/Vernalhav/nlw-proffy-backend) and configure it as described on its README.
After that, clone this repo and make it your working directory. Then,  
```yarn install``` or ```npm install``` to install the dependencies;  
```yarn start``` or ```npm start```  to run the server;  
After the server is set up (takes a while), you can visit the website at `localhost:3000`. Make sure the back-end is running! 
  
  
# Next steps
 There are still several shortcomings with this minimal version, the most glaring of which are the unchecked forms.
 It would also be interesting to allow a teacher to give classes of multiple subjects and select more than one time
 window. Lastly, the user should be able to search without specifying all the fields (this will imply displaying the teacher's available schedule in the search results).
